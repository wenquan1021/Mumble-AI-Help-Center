# What is Mumble AI？
Mumble is a voice-first AI workspace that captures your ideas and meetings without any context switching. You speak, and Mumble instantly turns everything into organized notes, summaries, and calendar events.

## The problem Mumble AI solves
Real work happens while you talk, listen, and move between tasks. That is also where most things get lost. Mumble keeps your ideas, conversations, and people organized automatically so you never lose momentum:

- turns voice into clean structured notes. As you talk, your knowledge base grows
- produces clean summaries even for long meeting sessions
- speeds up thinking by letting you invoke the agent through a shortcut

## What you get:
- 5x faster capture
- hands free note-taking and management
- a growing memory bank for tasks and relationships
- an AI assistant that keeps your notes and tasks organized

Over time, we’re adding more voice skills so you can manage schedules, create content, and handle tasks by voice, all in one place.
